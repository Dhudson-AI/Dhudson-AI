# Dillon Hudson

AI Product Developer building reliable, predictable AI systems designed for real world use.

I focus on shaping raw model output into stable, usable features through clear constraints, structured transformation pipelines, and practical UX. My work sits at the intersection of product design, model behavior control, and applied AI engineering.

## Featured Work

### Rewrite Studio
A focused rewriting and summarization demo built with the OpenAI API.

This project demonstrates how I design controlled text transformation pipelines, guide model behavior, and enforce predictable output through structured prompts and streamlined user flows.

### Submish (demo)
A multi step AI workflow for generating consistent, readable cover letters from structured inputs.

Highlights include tone selection, input validation, user facing constraints, and repeatable transformation logic designed for reliability over creative variance.

### Scind (demo)
A single purpose AI rewriting tool focused on predictability, tone preservation, and meaning retention.

Demonstrates input sanitation, clean transformation pipelines, and controlled output behavior designed for everyday professional use.

## Technical Focus

### AI and LLM Systems
- Prompt system design and structured prompt hierarchies  
- Model behavior control and output evaluation  
- Predictable transformation pipelines  
- Input validation and constraint enforcement  
- Cost aware API usage  

### Frontend and UX
- Clean user flows designed to reduce ambiguity  
- Form validation and interaction constraints  
- Readable, user friendly output presentation  
- Practical UI decisions aligned with backend behavior  

### Engineering and Integration
- OpenAI API integration  
- Python and SQL  
- Automation workflows and internal tooling  
- Request handling, logging, and basic infrastructure concerns  

## What I Focus On
- Building AI features with clear constraints to reduce unpredictable behavior  
- Turning raw model output into stable, usable product features  
- Designing systems where UX and model behavior reinforce each other  
- Prioritizing reliability, clarity, and trust over novelty  

## Current Direction
I am continuing to deepen my applied AI and product engineering skills, with emphasis on predictable model behavior, structured transformation pipelines, and clean user centered workflows.

I am interested in roles where I can design, build, and deliver AI features that scale responsibly and are used in real production environments.
