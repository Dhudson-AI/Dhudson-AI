# Dillon Hudson  
**AI Product Engineer focused on UX aligned LLM tooling and end to end feature delivery**

I build practical AI applications that combine clean architecture, predictable behavior, and streamlined frontend logic to create stable, user ready tools.  
My work centers on turning raw model output into reliable features through proper abstraction, controlled transformation pipelines, and product focused design.

## What I Focus On
- Building complete AI features with clear structure  
- Designing interactions that reduce ambiguity across input  
- Creating tools where model output feels intentional  
- Shaping UX around how LLMs behave and respond  
- Driving alignment between interface and backend logic

## Current Direction
I am leaning deeper into applied AI engineering:
- controlled pipelines  
- model reasoning stability  
- predictable LLM output  
- end to end feature delivery  
- rapid prototyping with clean UX  

I aim to join an AI product engineering team where I can design, build, and deliver stable LLM features at scale while contributing to a focused, high quality development culture.
